# Exercise: Identify the Type of CreateContainerError

## YAML File Description

Below is the YAML file we will examine:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: create-container-error-1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: container-1
      image: example-image:latest
```

## Exercise Instructions

Your task is to identify the specific type of `CreateContainerError` that could occur based on the provided YAML file. To do this, consider the image specification and any potential issues related to it.

1. Examine the YAML file carefully and identify what might be causing the `CreateContainerError`. Pay close attention to the image specification and whether it follows the correct format.

2. Based on your analysis, specify the type of `CreateContainerError` that could occur. Is it due to a missing image, incorrect image name, or another image-related issue?

3. If there are any corrective actions that can be taken to resolve the potential error, suggest them as part of your analysis.
