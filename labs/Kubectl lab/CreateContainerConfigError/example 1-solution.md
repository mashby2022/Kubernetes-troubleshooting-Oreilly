### Identifying and Troubleshooting CreateContainerConfigError: Missing Image in Kubernetes Pod

#### Problem Description:
The provided YAML manifest for a Kubernetes Pod has a missing image name, which can result in a "CreateContainerConfigError" when trying to create the pod.

#### YAML Manifest:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: missing-image-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: container-1
      image: 
      # Missing image name
```

#### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **YAML Validation:**
   - Before deploying the YAML to your Kubernetes cluster, ensure that the YAML file has valid syntax.
   - Use online YAML validators or command-line tools like `yamllint` or `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` for syntax validation.

2. **Monitor for Alerts:**
   - Botkube will monitor your Kubernetes cluster for pods with potential issues, including missing image names. When an issue is detected, you will receive an alert or notification in your configured messaging platform (e.g., Slack).

3. **Investigate the Alert:**
   - When you receive an alert, investigate the issue by checking the alert message, which should include details about the detected problem.

4. **Determine if it's a Missing Image Issue:**
   - Examine the alert message and the associated pod's metadata to determine if it's indeed a missing image issue. Look for clues such as an empty `image` field in the YAML or other relevant information.

5. **Correct the Issue:**
   - If you confirm that it's a missing image issue, edit your `missing-image-pod.yaml` file to add the missing image name to the container definition. If it's a different issue, investigate and address it accordingly.

6. **Apply the Corrected YAML:**
    - Apply the corrected YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster to create the pod with the image name corrected:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f missing-image-pod.yaml
    ```


By following these steps and referring to the provided sources, you can effectively identify and troubleshoot the "CreateContainerConfigError" related to missing image names in Kubernetes Pods using Botkube for monitoring and alerts.
