# Troubleshooting CreateContainerError: Missing Image

## YAML File Description

Below is the YAML file that we will examine:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: create-container-error-1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: container-1
      image: example-image:latest
```

## Error Identification

In the provided YAML file, the `image` field specifies an image name (`example-image:latest`) for the container. However, this image is non-existent or does not exist in the container registry. As a result, attempting to create a container using this image will lead to a `CreateContainerError`.

## Troubleshooting Steps

To resolve the "Missing Image" `CreateContainerError`, follow these steps:

### 1. Verify the Image Name

   - Double-check the image name specified in the YAML file. Ensure it is correct and includes both the image repository and a valid tag (e.g., `example-image:latest`).

### 2. Check Image Availability

   - Confirm that the image with the specified name and tag exists in the container registry you intend to use. You can do this by checking the registry's web interface or using container registry CLI commands.

### 3. Correct the Image Name

   - If the image name is incorrect or non-existent, update it to a valid image name that exists in your container registry.

### 4. Correct Tag Specification

   - Ensure that the tag specified (e.g., `latest`) corresponds to an available version of the image. You may need to specify a different tag if necessary.

### 5. Apply the YAML Configuration

   - Once you have corrected the image name and tag, apply the updated YAML configuration using `kubectl apply -f <filename.yaml>`.

### 6. Verify Pod Status

   - After applying the configuration, check the status of the Pod using `kubectl get pods`. Ensure that the Pod transitions to the "Running" state without errors.

## Conclusion

The "Missing Image" `CreateContainerError` is a common issue when working with Kubernetes Pods. By following the troubleshooting steps outlined in this guide and ensuring that the image name and tag are accurate and available, you can resolve this error and successfully create containers.

Remember to maintain consistency between your YAML configuration and the actual image availability to avoid such errors in Kubernetes deployments.
