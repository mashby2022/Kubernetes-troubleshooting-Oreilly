# CreateContainerConfigError (Configuration Incorrect or Missing): Causes and Resolution

## Diagnosis

CreateContainerConfigError occurs when a container is transitioning from pending to running. You can identify it by running the `kubectl get pods` command and looking at the pod status.

## Common Causes and Resolutions

Here's a summary of the main causes of the error and how to resolve them, primarily related to YAML configuration errors:

| CAUSE                           | RESOLUTION                                         |
| -------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------|
| ConfigMap is missing           | Identify the missing ConfigMap and create it in the namespace, or mount another, existing ConfigMap. |
| Secret is missing              | Identify the missing Secret and create it in the namespace, or mount another, existing Secret. |

## Resolution

To resolve CreateContainerConfigError, you need to determine whether a ConfigMap or Secret is missing. Follow these steps:

1. **Check for Missing ConfigMap or Secret**:

   Run the `kubectl describe` command and look for a message indicating one of these conditions, as shown in the example below:

   ```shell
   kubectl describe pod pod-missing-config
   ```

   Example message:
   ```
   Warning  Failed   34s (x6 over 1m45s)
   kubelet   Error: configmap "configmap-3" not found
   ```

2. **Verify the Existence of ConfigMap or Secret**:

   Run one of the following commands to check if the requested ConfigMap or Secret exists in the cluster:

   - To check for a ConfigMap:
     ```shell
     kubectl get configmap
     ```

   - To check for a Secret:
     ```shell
     kubectl get secret
     ```

   If the command returns null, it means that the ConfigMap or Secret is indeed missing.

3. **Create the Missing Object**:

   Once you've confirmed that the ConfigMap or Secret is missing, follow these instructions to create it:

   - To create a ConfigMap:
     ```shell
     kubectl create configmap <configmap-name> --from-file=<path-to-config-files> -n <namespace>
     ```

   - To create a Secret:
     ```shell
     kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-file=<path-to-secret-files> -n <namespace>
     ```

4. **Verify Object Existence**:

   Run the `get configmap` or `get secret` command again to ensure that the object now exists in the cluster.

   Once the object exists, the failed container should be successfully started within a few minutes.

5. **Confirm Pod Status**:

   After verifying the ConfigMap or Secret's existence, run `kubectl get pods` again to ensure that the pod status is now `Running`.

   Example output:

   ```
   NAME                   READY     STATUS     RESTARTS    AGE
   pod-missing-config     0/1       Running    0           1m23s
   ```

Please note that while the resolution process outlined above can address simple cases of ContainerConfigError, more complex scenarios may require a deeper investigation to identify and resolve the root cause.
