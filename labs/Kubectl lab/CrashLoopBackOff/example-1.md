# Exercise: Identify the CrashLoopBackOff Error

In this exercise, you will analyze a Kubernetes YAML file to identify what type of `CrashLoopBackOff` error is present.

**YAML File Description:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: crashloop-error-1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: container-1
      image: nginx:latest
      command: ["sleep", "1"]
```

**Task:**
1. Review the provided YAML file.
2. Identify the issue in the file that would result in a `CrashLoopBackOff` error when attempting to create the Pod.
3. Describe what is causing the error and why it leads to a `CrashLoopBackOff`.
4. Suggest a possible fix or correction for the issue.

**Hints:**
- Pay close attention to the container configuration and its behavior.
- Consider what happens when the container runs with the given command.
- Think about how Kubernetes manages containers and Pods.
